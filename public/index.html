      content="Pomodor is a simple app made to help you focus on what matters. It's based on a time management method called The Pomodoro Technique. Use Pomodor to break down your work into sessions, label them, and get a notification when each session is over. You can also customize the timer duration and have an insight into the statistics - find out how much time you've spent focusing, which days of the week are you the most productive, and what you've been working on. Sign in for free to sync your data across multiple devices."
